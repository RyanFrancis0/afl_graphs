My plan is to adopt a new style. A hybrid of the Soviet school and the Canadian school. A combination that requires the highest level of conditioning, speed,
creativity, and most of all, team chemistry.
...

We put our best on the ice with them last year. Professional all-stars. They still beat us.

It wasn't because you weren't good enough.
All-star teams fail because they rely solely on the individual's talent. The Soviets win because they take that talent and use it inside a system that's designed for
the betterment of the team.  My goal is to beat them at their own game.
...

Think you can win on talent alone? Gentlemen, you don't have enough talent to win on talent alone.
Again.
If you think you can come here and play the Norwegian National team, and tie them, and then go to the Olympics and win... You got another thing coming.
You better think about something else, each and every one of you. When you pull on that jersey, you represent yourself and your teammates.
	And the name on the front is a hell of a lot more important than the one on the back! Get that through your head!
Again!
Win, lose, or tie, you're gonna play like champions!
Again!
Kick it in the ass, Verchota! You want to go home early? Keep it going, Suter.
All the way to the line and all the way back. It's not that difficult.
Again!
Again.
Again!

Herb.         

What?

The rink manager wants to clean the ice and then go home.

Tell him to leave me the keys. I'll lock up.
Again.
Again.
You keep playing this way, you won't beat anybody who's even good, let alone great.
You want to make this team, then you better start playing at a level that's gonna force me to keep you here!
Again!      

Thank God.

Think we're getting out of here?

Hey.
Where you going?
Back on the line.
Again.
Send them.
Again.
Again.
How about it, Silky? You gonna be the first one to quit on me?
How about you, O.C.? You ready to go down?
Oh, I think I got my money on you, Verchota. You got a hot date in about an hour, but you're not looking too good for that right about now.
Send them.
Again.

Doc, I mean, this is madness, right?

This cannot be a team of common men because common men go nowhere. You have to be uncommon.
Again.

Herb! This has gone on long enough!

Everybody on that line.           

Somebody's going to get hurt!

Everybody get on that line.
Hey.
Again.
Again.             

Herb.

Come on, Craig. Blow the whistle.
Again.

Mike Eruzione! Winthrop, Massachusetts!

Who do you play for?

I play for... the United States of America.   

That's all, gentlemen.
